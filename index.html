<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://utrechtgeometrycentre.nl/">Utrecht Geometry Center</a> at Universiteit Utrecht working with <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~meier007/">Lennart Meier</a>. From September 2022 through December 2022, I was at the Hausdorff Institute in Bonn for the trimester on Spectral Methods in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics in June 2022 from UCLA, where my advisor was <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mikehill/">Mike Hill</a>. My CV is <a href="https://carrickchristian.github.io/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>My research is in equivariant, chromatic, and motivic homotopy. I am particularly interested in (connective) higher real $K$-theories and relating the various computations one can perform with these theories (e.g. their slice, homotopy fixed points, Adams, Adams-Novikov, etc. spectral sequences) to moduli problems in algebraic geometry via the language of stacks. See my <a href="https://carrickchristian.github.io/research/">Research</a> page for more. </p>

I've collected here some expository notes of mine. 

* [Homology of representation spheres](https://carrickchristian.github.io/HomologyRepSpheres.pdf). This note explains how to calculate the $E_2$-page of the slice spectral sequences appearing in Real-oriented homotopy theory, working out the case $G=C_4$ in detail.

* [Stacks and Real-oriented homotopy theory](https://carrickchristian.github.io/main.pdf). This is my Ph.D. thesis. It contains various results that appear in my published papers or will appear in papers in preparation. At one point, I had notes on my webpage related to stacks and chromatic homotopy that some people found useful. I have removed these as they have all been subsumed by (and improved in) Chapter 2 of my thesis.

* Quillen's elementary proofs. My bachelor's thesis is available upon request.

* [Segal's classifying spaces and spectral sequences](https://carrickchristian.github.io/SegalTalkNotes.pdf). These are old notes I wrote on Segal's classic paper.

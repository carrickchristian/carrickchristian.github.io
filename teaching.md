Teaching has always been and will remain an important part of my mathematics experience. I have included here various parts of my teaching experience, and my [CV](https://carrickchristian.github.io/cv.pdf) contains additional information. My teaching statement and teaching reviews are also available upon request.

* Stacks in Chromatic Homotopy, UCLA Participating Seminar Winter 2020. [Syllabus](https://carrickchristian.github.io/StacksSyllabus.pdf)
* Higher Real $K$-theories and the Slice Spectral Sequence, UCLA Participating Seminar Fall 2020. [Syllabus](https://carrickchristian.github.io/EO_nSyllabus.pdf)
* Structured Ring Spectra, UCLA Juvitop Winter 2019.
* Computations in Chromatic Homotopy, UCLA Juvitop Winter 2019.
